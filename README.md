## Design
I initially started getting ideas from pintrest, and after awhile I looked through all the inspiration I collected and noticed one common theme. Old Traditional Japanese/Chinese Paintings.


From there I started to gather colors, and fonts that suited the website. Once I was happy with the colors and fonts I chose thats when I started drawing up designs of how I wanted my website to look like.
**Figma link above to the whole design process and wireframes.**

I then proceeded to slowly code and put together. Eventually it looked like this:

Then I added a little section of js to change themes to make a sort of **night mode**, and added a button to a part of the sun/moon.

## Questions
### 1.
Arpanet was the first iteration of the internet and was used for the military. In 1984 Arpanet was renamed to the internet and it was linked to 1000 hosts at universities and corporate labs. Today there are over 440 million computers connected.

### 2.
You use a web browser to access websites, you will then put in a domain name into the URL bar of the web browser. The doamin name is just a series of numbers in which the DNS handles the process to find the IP Address of where the website is located at. From there you get to access and see the website in your web browser.

### 3.
One Aspect of the development of the internet i chose is open source. With the introduction of open source, the internet, with many things such as web browsers like Firefox, who then wrote up documentation on their website. Through the use of the internet and open source, stuff like HTML CSS has evolved drastically, and many other big name companies are slowly converting over to open source.
